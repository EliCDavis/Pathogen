Play as a virus and destroy your host!

## Pitch

### Feeling BLOODTHIRSTY?

Why not play on your PC a Star Fox 64 inspired  on rails shooter where you play as a virus where you personably take down your host from the inside?

### Your Mission

Take control of the deadliest virus known to man as you single handedly wreak havoc on the host’s nervous system

### Who You Are

You’re the first strain of the world’s deadliest biologically engineered super virus made to target high profile government officials

### Your Path

Travel through the bloodstream to reach the brain. Carve your path through multitudes of red blood cells while fending off aggressive white blood cells.

### Your Target

The Brain. Surrounded by white Alert cells and orange Attack cells, the brain is not going down without a fight

### The Final Showdown

If you get too close to an Alert cell, it will call Attack cells to destroy you.

If you are overwhelmed, YOU WILL BE ELIMINATED.

### Why You Should Fund Us

Feel the adrenaline of rushing through the blood to destroy the brain
